#summary Memcached's Build Farm

= The Build Farm =

Memcached builds are tests against a variety of hosts and configurations via [http://buildbot.net/ buildbot] before and after every bit of code is accepted.

== Builders ==

The following builders make up this testing pool:

  * FreeBSD 7.2 AMD 64
  * FreeBSD 7.2 i386
  * OpenBSD 4.5 AMD 64
  * OpenSolaris x86 (one with and one without dtrace)
  * OS X 10.5 Intel
  * OS X 10.5 PPC
  * Solaris 10 Sparc (one with and one without dtrace)
  * Ubuntu 8.04 i386
  * Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64 (gcc 4.3 and icc)
  * Ubuntu 9.10 x86_64 (gcc 4.4)

== Needed Builders ==

  * More GCC 4.4 (Our Ubuntu 9.10 is currently a part-time builder)
  * NetBSD
  * Something important to you that's not already covered.
