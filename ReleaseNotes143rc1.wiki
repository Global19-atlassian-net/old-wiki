= New Features =

== Support for SASL Authentication ==

Some installations of memcached are not in controlled environments
where simple network filtering keeps bad guys out of your stuff.  To
help with those other environments, we've introduced SASL support.
You can read more about it here:

== Also Noteworthy, Slab Optimizations ==

Objects on the larger end of the limit should be generally more memory
efficient now as more slabs are created (thus are more granular).
