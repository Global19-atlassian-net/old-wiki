== Contributing to the Wiki ==

Anyone's free to contribute. Due to spam issues and trying to consolidate product pages, wiki edits now require authorization. Don't be let down though! We want your content/corrections and getting in changes is trivial!

First:

 * Think up something to change!

Then:

 * Send it to the mailing list!

Someone will chuck it into the wiki or refine it until it can be in short order. If you contribute a few good changes, we'll grant you membership so you can do further edits on your own. Or just ask up front for acess. Whatever you want.
