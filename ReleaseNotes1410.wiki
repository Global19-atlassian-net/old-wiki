== Overview ==

This release is focused around thread scalability and performance
improvements. This release should be able to feed data back faster than any
network card can support as of this writing.

== Fixes ==

  * disable issue 140's test.
  * push cache_lock deeper into item_alloc
  * use item partitioned lock for as much as possible
  * Remove the depth search from item_alloc
  * move hash calls outside of cache_lock
  * Use spinlocks for main cache lock
  * remove uncommon branch from asciiprot hot path
  * Allow all tests to run as root


== New Features ==

=== Performance ===

For more details, read the commit messages from git. Each change was carefully
researched to not increase memory requirements and to be safe from deadlocks.
Each change was individually tested via mc-crusher
(http://github.com/dormando/mc-crusher) to ensure benefits.

Older versions of memcached are plenty fast for just about all users. This
changeset is to allow more flexibility in future feature additions, as well as
improve memcached's overall latency on busy systems.

Keep an eye on your hitrate and performance numbers. Please let us know
immediately if you experience any regression from these changes. We have tried
to be as thorough as possible in testing, but you never know.
