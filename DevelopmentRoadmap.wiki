#summary memcached development roadmap

= Introduction =

The memcached development model aims to have regular updates for stable releases (dot-even) and regular builds available for development releases (dot-odd).  

== Proposed Release Cycle ==

  * 3 weeks after each new stable release, we release -rc1 for the next release.
  * New -rc's will be kicked out daily or bidaily if there are fixes.
  * After a minimum of 3 days in RC, unless there are still bug reports coming in, stable is released.

This should lead to a stable release roughly once per month. Exceptions
can be made, as usual. Major bug finds, of course, warrant earlier releases. 
Cycles with large code changes all at once might warrant
an earlier cut to -rc1 and a 2-3 week -rc cycle.

The release may be done by any of the core committers to memcached, but the process requires separation of contribution and review (i.e. the author does not commit/review their own changes).  

= Near Term Roadmap =

== Updates to 1.4 ==

The 1.4 tree is in maintenance mode. However, since 1.6 is taking a long time
to stabilize, we will resume producing regular updates to 1.4. If you have
bugs, fixes, or feature requests for 1.4, please go ahead and submit them.

== Development Branch: 1.6 ==

The 1.6 release is a major rewrite of the system. It supports modular engines,
protocol extensions, and has had significant internal reworking.

The goal for this branch, at of this writing, is to vet these changes to
ensure they are stable, make sense, and are generally the right thing to do.
